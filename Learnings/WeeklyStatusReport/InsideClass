What you learnt inside the class?

Week1

#Week1
 --Firstly you made us write the pros and cons of pokemon go which I liked at first in the course.
 --Then made us use the augmented reality and the location maps in different possible areas .
 --By that I came to know that new ideas originate by closely looking at the existing ones.
 --I also observed that many people didnot know about pokemon go and faced problems when asked to think of improving it.
 
#Week2
  --Learned about the importance of quality software.
  --Knew about the factors that are responsible for making quality software.
  --Thought of a few project ideas and shared them with the class.
  
#Week3
 --Didnot understand much about software enginnering but knew a little about it.
 --Learned about the factors that influence software engineering.
 --Learned that to be a good software engineer one has to have a good hand in 5 things namely
    -Programming
    -Design
    -Process
    -Communication
    -TeamWork
    

#Week4
    
---There are three different worlds in software engineering
	1 Problem world
	2 Solution world
  	3 Design world

---Rely on role not person

---There are two types of requirements functional and non-functional
	Functional requirements describe what the system must do
		eg:Authenication
	Non Functional requirements describe how the system must behave
		eg:Scalability
	**Now slowly difference between functional and non functional requirements are going away
--- In REQUIREMENT ENGINEERING elicitation is a process where requirements are taken from stakeholders and users
--- There will be thousands of requirements of which only some sould be selected based on stakeholders,funding
--- Think broad be limited


#Week 5
 
--We discussed more about agile modals.
--We dicussed scrum in detail and had a debate on agile manefasto.
--We learned about backlogs,should get updated with team member once in 24 hour,should set some fix time period for completion of project. 
--We disscussed about projects and finalised to go through scrum modal.
--Software quality ,code clarity.
--Estimation of software,project can be estimated by LOC,function points.
    
  
#Week6

--The software design was taught in the class
--Design involves analysis,synthesis and evaluation of goals,constraints,assumptions,decision and ideas
--Discussed few things about UML
--Did an activity on Web security analysis involving design
--Software design represents an abstracted form of the plan and modules required.
--Design modules should support maintenance and verification.
--Model-driven development is introduced in the class.
